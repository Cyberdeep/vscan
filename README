`vscan` is a toolkit for making fast but crude measurements of the prevalence
of named textual features in algorithmically selected samples of large corpora.

Typical applications include

  a) hunting for JavaScript malware in FTP-accessible file systems

  b) hunting for call-sites of deprecated cryptographic primitives in large
     collections of source code

To install `vscan`, please follow the instructions in the `INSTALL` file
located alongside this `README` or check to see whether `vscan` is available
through your favorite package manager.

For information on how to use `vscan`, please see the overview and command-
specific documentation in the `docs/` subdirectory of the source code.

Finally, please write if you have trouble getting `vscan` to work or if you've
done cool things with `vscan` that we might want to merge -- we'd love to hear
from you!
