# NAME

vscan - a text scanning suite.

# DESCRIPTION

vscan is a toolkit for making fast but crude measurements of the prevalence of
named textual features in algorithmically selected samples of large corpora.

# COMMANDS

*vscan-scan-dir*
:   Recursively scan a directory using filters and sensors as described in
    `vscan-config`(5).

*vscan-scan-tarball*
:   Perform an offline scan on an archive of content samples captured by an
    earlier invocation of `vscan-scan-dir`(1).

*vscan-summarize*
:   Convert scan logs into a queryable `sqlite3`(1) database of scan results.

*vscan-report*
:   Tabulate descriptive statistics from a summary database.

*vscan-view*
:   Render a highlighted view of an input file using sensors as described in
    `vscan-config`(5).

# EXAMPLE

    $ cat config.lua

    -- Only examine header files.
    filenames = "^.*(?i:h)$"

    -- Ignore file mtimes.
    last_modified = nil

    -- Log sensor hits.
    mode = "search"

    -- Search for words that resemble the names of
    -- old hash functions like "md5" and "MD2".
    sensors = {
      ["old_hash"] = "(?ims:md[245])",
    }

    $ vscan-scan-dir /usr > log
    $ vscan-summarize log
    $ vscan-report
