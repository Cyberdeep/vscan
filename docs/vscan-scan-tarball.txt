# NAME

vscan-scan-tarball - scan a tarball with sensors from config.lua

# SYNOPSIS

*vscan-scan-tarball* PATH [PATH...]

# OPTIONS

None.

# DESCRIPTION

`vscan-scan-tarball` uses the filter information, sensors, and scan mode defined
in `./config.lua` to scan the tarballs named as its arguments. It is the
offline counterpart to *vscan-scan-dir*.

Unlike *vscan-scan-dir*, `vscan-scan-tarball` only supports `search` mode
scanning. In `search` mode, *vscan-scan-tarball* writes its results to stdout.
Each result consists of a line starting with a typecode followed by one or more
space-delimited fields. The possible lines are:

 `F <qpath> <feature> <capture>?`
:    Features

 `P <qpath> <feature>+`
:    Path summaries

 `C <qpath> <num dirs> <num files> <num interesting>`
:    Count statistics

 `E <freeform text>`
:    Errors

Fields with label `qpath` and `captures` are percent-encoded.

# EXAMPLES

Scan a tarball for instances of header files which mention old hashes.

    cat > config.lua <<EOF
    sensors = { ["old_hash"] = "(?ims:md[245])" }
    EOF
    vscan-scan-tarball /tmp/examples.tar.gz > results
    vscan-summarize results
    vscan-report

Continue with *vscan-summarize* followed by *vscan-report*.
