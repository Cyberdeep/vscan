# NAME

vscan-summarize - aggregate several scan logs into a database

# SYNOPSIS

*vscan* *summarize* PATH [PATH...]

# OPTIONS

None.

# DESCRIPTION

`vscan-summarize` aggregates data from a vscan `config.lua` file along with
results from previously performed scans into an SQLite3 database located at
`./summary.db`.

Presently, the database schema consists of four tables, named `feats`, `paths`,
`samples`, and `hits`.

    CREATE TABLE feats (name TEXT PRIMARY KEY, regex TEXT);

    CREATE TABLE hits (cp INTEGER, pathid INTEGER,
                       featid INTEGER, sampleid INTEGER,
                       PRIMARY KEY (pathid, featid, sampleid));

    CREATE TABLE paths (path TEXT PRIMARY KEY);

    CREATE TABLE samples (sample TEXT PRIMARY KEY);

Columns named "`*id`" are foreign keys referencing the implicit "`ROWID`"
column of the foreign table mentioned in the column name.

The database also contains three indices:

    CREATE INDEX idx_hits_cp ON hits (cp);
    CREATE INDEX idx_hits_featid ON hits (featid);
    CREATE INDEX idx_hits_pathid ON hits (pathid);

which are used by the queries made by *vscan-report*.

# EXAMPLES

Perform a scan and summarize its results:

    ...
    vscan-scan-dir /usr > ./result
    vscan-summarize ./result
    echo ".dump" | sqlite3 ./summary.db

Continue with *vscan-report* or additional analysis with new signatures.
