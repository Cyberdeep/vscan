# NAME

vscan-highlight - highlight a file

# SYNOPSIS

*vscan-highlight* QPATH...

# OPTIONS

None.

# DESCRIPTION

`vscan-highlight` scans and highlights individual files using sensors defined
in `./config.lua`. The files to highlight should be specified via
percent-encoded paths such as are produced by `vscan-scan-dir`(1) and
`vscan-scan-tarball`(1).

`vscan-highlight` works by HTML-entity-encoding two unspecified delimiter
characters, using these characters to mark input regions which match the
specified sensors, HTML-escaping the result, and enclosing the resulting
escaped marked regions in `<span class="hit">` tags. The resulting HTML is
intended to be combined by the caller with caller-specified CSS before being
rendered, e.g., in a browser.

`vscan-highlight` writes its results to stdout. Each result consists of a line
starting with a typecode followed by one or more space-delimited fields. The
possible lines are:

 `F <qpath> <feature> <capture>?`
:    Features

 `P <qpath> <feature>+`
:    Path summaries

 `H <qpath> <html>`
:    Highlighted text

 `E <freeform text>`
:    Errors

The HTML output by `vscan-highlight` is HTML-escaped by replacing all
occurrences of the ASCII characters `<`, `&`, `=`, `"`, `(`, `)`, space (0x20),
newline (0x0a), and carriage return (0x0d) with equivalent HTML hexadecimal
entities.

(NB: the HTML output by `vscan-highlight` is *not* ANSI-control-character
escaped and may contain arbitrary binary strings, except as previously
described!)

# EXAMPLES

Enter a scan directory and highlight a collected file:

    cd $SCAN_ID
    vscan-highlight exs/1234/sample.html

Continue with `vscan-view`(1).
