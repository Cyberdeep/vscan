# NAME

vscan-scan-dir - scan a directory with sensors from config.lua

# SYNOPSIS

*vscan-scan-dir* PATH [PATH...]

# OPTIONS

None.

# DESCRIPTION

`vscan-scan-dir` uses the filter information, sensors, and scan mode defined
in `./config.lua` to scan the directories named as its arguments.

In `search` mode, *vscan-scan-dir* writes its results to stdout.  Each result
consists of a line starting with a typecode followed by one or more
space-delimited fields. The possible lines are:

 `F <qpath> <feature> <capture>?`
:    Features

 `P <qpath> <feature>+`
:    Path summaries

 `C <qpath> <num dirs> <num files> <num interesting>`
:    Count statistics

 `E <freeform text>`
:    Errors

Fields with label `qpath` and `captures` are percent-encoded.

In `collect` mode, *vscan-scan-dir* writes samples of files with interesting
names to a compressed tarball in `./examples.tar.gz`. These samples can be
scanned offline with *vscan-scan-tarball* and can be archived for longitudinal
analysis.

# EXAMPLES

Scan /usr for instances of header files which mention old hashes.

    cat > config.lua <<EOF
    filenames = "^.*(?i:h)$"
    mode = "search"
    last_modified = nil
    sensors = { ["old_hash"] = "(?ims:md[245])" }
    EOF
    vscan-scan-dir /usr > results
    vscan-summarize results
    vscan-report

Continue with *vscan-summarize* followed by *vscan-report*.
